> Other use case of Chain of Responsibility

Use Case	                    Why Chain of Responsibility Works

Logger System	                Multiple handlers based on severity
ATM Withdrawal System	        Each denomination processes part of the amount
Servlet Filters / Middleware	Request passed through filter chain
Expense Approval System	        Escalation of approval responsibility
Event Handling in UI	        Event bubbling through handler hierarchy
Spam Filter	                    Each filter checks specific spam criteria

> Can we instantiate the object in any order
Yes we can but its advisable to Start with least severe (INFO) and escalate up to most severe (ERROR),
unless you have a specific reason. Otherwise we can have performance issue
